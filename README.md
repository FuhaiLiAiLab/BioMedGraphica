Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific discovery by leveraging its scalable capabilities to integrate and analyze large-scale datasets for knowledge mining. Foundation models—such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs)—are enabling general-purpose AI, yet they rely on highly structured data that is rarely available in the biomedical domain.

In contrast, biomedical data remains **fragmented**, with knowledge scattered across publications and inconsistent databases, each using diverse nomenclature systems. These discrepancies, spanning from genes to clinical traits, present significant challenges for **AI in Precision Health and Medicine (AI4PHM)**.

To address this, we introduce **BioMedGraphica**, an **all-in-one platform** for:
- Biomedical data integration across 43 databases
- Unified **Text-Attributed Knowledge Graph (TAKG)** generation
- Multi-omics and prior knowledge-driven graph AI applications
